# Slam-VDB: Simultaneous localization and mapping framework using OpenVDB backend
[![documentation workflow](https://img.shields.io/github/actions/workflow/status/mlsdpk/slam_vdb/deploy-docs.yaml?style=flat&label=documentation)]()

SLAM-VDB is an open-source, high-performance 2D/3D SLAM system, built on the [Robot Operating System (ROS)](https://www.ros.org/) with [OpenVDB](https://www.openvdb.org/) as the map storage backend, designed for efficient map management and real-time capabilities. It aims to be sensor-agnostic with a modular, plugin-based architecture for easy customization. Our focus is on providing fast, low CPU usage mapping that can handle large-scale environments, with future plans for lifelong mapping and continuous updates.
